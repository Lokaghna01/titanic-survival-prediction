# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Description:
This project aims to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning. We use various passenger features like age, gender, class, and more to train a model.

## Task Objectives:
- **Preprocess data**: Handle missing values and encode categorical features.
- **Train a classification model**: Use algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or others to predict survival.
- **Evaluate performance**: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Steps to Run the Project:

### Prerequisites:
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- **Dependencies**: You need to install the required Python libraries. These are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Running the Project:
Follow these steps to set up and run the Titanic survival prediction model:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   Clone the project repository to your local machine by running:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/titanic-survival-prediction.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   Once youâ€™ve cloned the repository, go into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd titanic-survival-prediction
3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   Install all the required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt` using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. **Run the main script**:
   To run the project, execute the `main.py` script. This will train the model and output evaluation metrics:
   ```bash
   python main.py
